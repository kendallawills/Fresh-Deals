                    <h3>About FreshDeals</h3>
                    <p>Most of our users ask us, why are you called FreshDeals? We like to chuckle at 
                        that question because it seems so obvious to us. The freshest deals at the 
                        freshest prices. Simple as that. We were founded on this belief and it helps 
                        guide every decision we make day in and day out.</p>
                    <p>Well there's one other reason we're called FreshDeals: our fearless founders. We 
                        were created as a pop-and-pop shop in 1912 by two young entrepeneurs: Johnny 
                        Fresh and Punxutawney Deal. Since those days, we've scaled to serve organic 
                        ingredients to the entire world. Though Johnny and Punx no longer run 
                        FreshDeals, we are commited to keeping their dream alive. We hope you've 
                        enjoyed your experiences with FreshDeals over the past decades. We're excited 
                        to show you how much more we can do as we continue to grow!</p>
